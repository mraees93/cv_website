      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        In the past I have studied sports science and worked full-time as a fitness trainer, I have trained and led huge groups, as much as 
        15 people at a time. I needed a website for my business but it was a bit too expensive at the time so I thought I'd try to
        learn to code to make my website. In the process, I enjoyed solving problems with code and thought I could probably make 
        a career out of it. 
        <br><br>
        I applied at Umuzi and gained colossal amounts of knowledge while I was still training clients part-time. 
        When I started at Umuzi until the present, I found out that many of the soft skills mentioned above I had obtained from my 
        fitness career. 
        <br><br>
        In general, I enjoy socializing with people, working with people and I feel 
        I'm a natural leader as well. I feel these soft skills would be highly beneficial in my aspiring software career.
      </p>
